COMP361 Assignment 2 - Cracking the Genetic Code

Usage
-----

In order to make this as simple as possible I haven't included any gems etc.
You should be able to just run it on the command line as such:
* For the program: ruby program.rb
* For the tests:   ruby test.rb

Unfortunately I haven't gone to the effort of adding commandline parameters.
You will have to add entries to program.rb yourself.

Program Structure
-----------------

* gene_aligner.rb contains the main algorithm
* program.rb is a script for running the algorithm
* tester.rb conatins a class used for testing
* test.rb is a script for running the tests
* helper.rb has a method for printing result's tables
